		<h2>Vice president Medinmode</h2>
        <p>
    	Medinmode is a fashion and beauty association. My role on her enabled me to really understand the importance and the challenges of teamwork but also the administrative and creative project management. It gave me the opportunity to develop my managerial and organizational skills: organizing events and professional meetings, managing teams and partners such as Galleries Lafayette. I had the chance to supervise and collaborate with all the members, in each department : partnerships, events, communication, creation and beauty, each taught me a lot.
